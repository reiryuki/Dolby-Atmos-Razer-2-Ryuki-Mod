  Run at Terminal Emulator before flash:
  - `su`
  - `setprop dolby.force.permissive 1`
- If Dolby force close, just reinstall again.
- Make sure manifest.xml is patched correctly.
- Use Audio Compatibility Patch if you encounter processing problem.
- If you have some issues, like ringtones, alarm tones doesn't work, or calls opposite person doesn't hear, [do this fix.](https://t.me/audioryukimods/543)
